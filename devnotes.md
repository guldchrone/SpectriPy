# Developer notes

This documents describes the general structure of the package and provides
helpful references to code and files for contributors. Preferably read the
**full** document.


## General info

**What is this package good for?**

- The [Spectra](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/Spectra) package (and
  the `Spectra` class) provides a powerful infrastructure for mass spectrometry
  (MS) data in R (possibly see the
  [SpectraTutorials](https://jorainer.github.io/SpectraTutorials/) for more
  information, in particular the
  [Spectra-backends](https://jorainer.github.io/SpectraTutorials/articles/Spectra-backends.html)
  vignette for a description of the data structure).

- Powerful MS data algorithms algorithms are also available in Python,
  e.g. in the library [matchms](https://github.com/matchms/matchms).

- Why re-implement what's already available?

- This package *translates* an R `Spectra` object into the *matchms* Python
  `Spectrum` data structure and allows you to call functions of the *matchms*
  package and translate the results back into R data objects.


## General package structure

**Where to find what?**

- The *R* folder contains all R source files.

	- *R/conversion.R* contains functions to convert between R and Python data
	  structures (e.g. between `Spectra::Spectra` and `matchms.Spectrum`). The
	  conversion of the Python result into an R data type is handled by R's
	  *reticulate* package, which can convert all basic data types between R and
	  Python.

	- *R/compareSpectriPy.R* contains the mass spectral similarity calculation
	  functions. The core function is the internal
	  [`.compare_spectra_python()`](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/blob/main/R/compareSpectriPy.R#L304-L333)
	  function that manages the Anaconda environment, translates the data to
	  Python data structures and calls the Python command using
	  `py_run_string()`. The Python command itself is generated by the
	  `python_command()`
	  (e.g. [this](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/blob/main/R/compareSpectriPy.R#L255-L266))
	  command called on the *parameter* object
	  [`CosineGreedyParam`](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/blob/main/R/compareSpectriPy.R#L132-L153). To
	  use a new similarity calculation function or a new Python
	  functionality/algorithm, ideally a new *param* object is implemented with
	  the `python_command()` method, which returns the python command that is
	  specific to the new algorithm/Python functionality to run in Python.

	- *R/basilisk.R* cointains the Python environment definition and
	  required/used Python libraries (see below for more information).

- The *tests* folder contains all unit tests. A general *testthat.R* file that
  configures and sets up the tests and a unit test file for each R source file
  (named *test_<R-source-file>.R*) within the *testthat* folder.

- The *vignettes* folder contains an R markdown document that explains the use
  of the SpectriPy package using examples. This is a good starting point to
  explore the package and its functionality.


## Python setup and configuration

**Where are python libraries defined?**

- *SpectriPy* uses the R *reticulate* package for conversion between (basic) R
  and Python data types.and relies on Bioconductor's
  [*basilisk*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/basilisk) package to setup and
  manage the Python envrionment.

- The Python environment and required libraries are defined in the
  *R/basilisk.R* file. Different environments can be defined in that file with
  the required libraries (including versions).

- To execute Python code from a certain library, the `basiliscRun()` function is
  used, with the respective environment providing this library being enabled
  and disabled with the `basiliskStart()` and `basiliskStop()` functions.

- The *reticulate* `r_to_py()` and `py_to_r()` functions are used for conversion
  of basic data types between R and Python and *vice versa*. To use these
  functions, an Python environment with the *matchms* library must be used (or
  the one defined in *SpectriPy* and managed by *basilisk* needs to be activated
  first using `cl <- basiliskStart(SpectriPy:::matchms_env)` (see package
  vignette for an example).


## Test data

**What data can be used in tests?**

- The package does not contain test data files. Test and example data are
  created *manually* by defining *m/z* and intensity values of MS peaks. If
  necessary, data files can be added (e.g. in MGF format) and placed in an
  *inst/extdata* folder.

- Alternatively, sample files in mzML format are available in Bioconductor's
  [*msdata*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/msdata) package.

- To test the package and newly created functionality: add the respective unit
  tests to the *tests/testthat* folder and evaluate them by e.g. running the
  following `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = "--no-manual")` command in an R session
  started in the package folder.


## Potential contributions and extensions

**What can be implemented?**

- Add new similarity calculation functionality to `SpectriPy`. See also
  [issue #19](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/issues/19).

- Integrate other Python libraries? More a discussion - see [issue
  #24](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/issues/24).

- Integrate functionality for spectra processing, downstream analysis
  (e.g. cleaning), ... See also
  [issue #20](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/issues/20).

- Ability to translate additional data structures. See also [issue
  #18](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/issues/18).

- More efficient translation of data structures. Better handling of
  metadata. See also [issue
  #17](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/issues/17).

- Improve documentation. See also [issue
  #25](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/issues/25).

- Define a use case analysis (or ideally several): show how data can be analyzed
  with the SpectriPy package and contrast that with a "quarto" or "Jupyter
  Notebook" document directly combining the R and Python code: is there really
  need for additional convenience functionality within an R package, or can the
  same, or more, be achieved with e.g. "quarto"? What are the benefits of
  *bundling*/wrapping Python functionality into R functions? See also [issue
  #21](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/issues/21).

- Add more use cases and examples to the package vignette
  (*vignettes/SpectriPy.Rmd*) file. See also [issue
  #26](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectriPy/issues/26).
